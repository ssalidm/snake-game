# Snake Game üêç

This is a simple Snake Game implemented in Python using the Turtle graphics library. The game features a snake that the player controls to eat food and grow longer. The objective is to achieve the highest score possible without colliding with the walls or the snake's own tail.

## Getting Started

To run the Snake Game, make sure you have Python installed on your system. Clone this repository and run the `snake_game.py` file.

```bash
python snake_game.py
```
## How to Play
* Use the arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to control the snake's direction.
* The snake will continuously move in the current direction.
* The goal is to eat the food represented by a green square to increase your score.
* Avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own tail.

## Rules
* Collision with the walls or the snake's own tail will end the game.
* Each time the snake eats food, it will grow longer.

## Features
